ReleaseZri - Meaningful and minimalist release notes for developers
```

Managing manual release notes is hard. Therefore, everyone tends to generate release notes
from commit messages. But, you won't get a meaningful release note at the end. ReleaseZri offers
you a simple strategy to maintain a human-friendly changelog and generate release notes automatically.
It also gives you GitHub Action workflow steps that you can simply copy-paste into your projects.
